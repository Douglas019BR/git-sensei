### Why This Course is in English 🌍

This course is written in English to help you familiarize yourself with technical terms used in the global development community. While we provide a Portuguese version for accessibility, we strongly encourage you to read the English version whenever possible.

**Why English matters for developers:**
- **Global Communication**: The vast majority of programming documentation, forums, and resources are in English
- **Industry Standard**: Most code comments, variable names, and technical discussions happen in English
- **Career Opportunities**: English proficiency opens doors to international projects and collaborations
- **Open Source**: Contributing to major open source projects requires English communication skills
- **Technical Vocabulary**: Learning Git commands and concepts in English helps you understand documentation better

Don't worry if your English isn't perfect. Technical English is more straightforward than conversational English. The more you practice reading technical content in English, the more comfortable you'll become! 💪

*Portuguese speakers: A versão em português está disponível na pasta [pt-br](./pt-br/README.md), mas recomendamos fortemente que pratiquem lendo em inglês sempre que possível.*

### What is a README? 📄

A README file is the first thing people see when they visit a repository. It's like the front door to your project! 🏠

#### Why README Files Are Important ⭐

- **First Impression**: It's often the first interaction users have with your project
- **Documentation**: Explains what your project does and how to use it
- **Instructions**: Provides setup and installation guidelines
- **Communication**: Shares your vision and goals for the project
- **Community Building**: Helps others understand how they can contribute

A good README makes your project accessible and user-friendly. Even simple projects benefit from clear documentation that explains the purpose and usage. As you progress in your Git journey, you'll appreciate well-documented repositories and learn to create your own! 📝
