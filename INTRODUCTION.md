# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

Imagine you're drawing a picture. You start with a sketch, then you add colors, and then you add details. What if you make a mistake and want to go back to a previous version of your drawing? Git is like a time machine for your projects. It helps you save different versions of your work, so you can always go back if you need to.

Git is a **Version Control System (VCS)**. That's a fancy way of saying it's a tool that helps you keep track of changes in your files over time.

## A Little Bit of History

Git was created by a very smart person named [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds). He also created Linux, which is a popular (and the best in my opnion) operating system for computers. He needed a better way to keep track of all the changes that many different people were making to the Linux project. So, in 2005, he created Git!

## Why is Git so Cool?

*   **You can go back in time:** If you mess up, you can easily go back to a version that worked.
*   **You can work with friends:** Git makes it easy for many people to work on the same project at the same time without messing up each other's work.
*   **You can experiment:** You can create a separate copy of your project to try out new ideas without changing the original. This is like having a secret laboratory for your project!
*   **You can see the changes in a historical order:** : You can see who makes a especific changes or how was the old implementation, how the first programmer of this project thinks the structure...
*   **You can work in the same project in more than one computer** You can start you work in a computer A, save changes on git and continue in a computer B, it's valid too work in differents parts of the same project without break project.
